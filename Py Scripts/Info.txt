These scripts generate plot results. 

Each script includes the variable plot_name, which is used in naming the HTML plot file. 

A function within each script creates an output folder for the plots,
and copies the script into this folder. 

Because scripts can be run with different parameters or CSV files, 
this way all parameters are documented in the script along with the HTML plot files. 

To use the scripts with modules, they need to be imported into the Python console first.
