Download the tool ‘DB Browser for SQLite’ version 3.13.0 from:
https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/

With the DB SQLite Explorer tool you can easily create an empty database and name it e.g. CZFOI.db. 


Download the file Vesely_106_202403141131.csv and import the CSV data into a table, e.g. ‘Czech’, in the new database.

Download CSV file: https://github.com/PalackyUniversity/uzis-data-analysis/blob/main/data/Vesely_106_202403141131.tar.xz


The SQL query ‘All SQL Queries.sql’ in the SQLQueries folder analyses the data from the table czech,
and displays the results in several different database views.
Execute the query in the query window of the DB SQLite Explorer tool.

The database views have been exported to the terra Folder,
by right-clicking on the view in the DB Browser for SQLite tool.


The phyton scripts then analyse the aggregated data from the csv files, 
calculate and saves the cumulated values to PVT_CUM csv files, and display the Data visually. 

Open the desired py scripts with Visual Studio Code and execute them, 
which will create the interactive html plot files in the "Plot Results" Folder .
